# Introduction

> Are you cursed with knowledge in general?... well then consider becoming a Quiz Wizard!

![](https://github.com/pbiswas101/Quizard/blob/master/assets/logo.png)

A [React][1] based application implemented using the [JAMstack][2] principles where one passing the quiz shall win the title of **Quizard**!

###### Project Idea

An online quiz app where questions would be asked on topics selected by the user. This is a timer-based quiz with four options for every question with only one being correct. Now, after successfully completing the quiz, the user will be mailed with a digital badge and the score reflecting his/her performance!

## <a href="#1">Tools</a>

Since this is a JAMstack application there won't be any server-side programming involved. Most of the backend work are going to be abstracted away with:
- [Formspree][3] - for sending mails
- [Netlify][4] - for hosting the site

Now, frontend (as mentioned above) is to implemented with:
- [React][1] - library for building UI
- [Materialize.css][5] - library for designing UI

## <a href="#2">Color Pallete</a>

The color palette are inspired from the logo itself and the entire application must reflect these set of colors:

- <strong>#555273</strong>
- <strong>#78758f</strong>
- <strong>#a4b0c3</strong>
- <strong>#8594af</strong>
- <strong>#65799b</strong>
- <strong>#83859e</strong>
- <strong>#ffffff</strong>
- <strong>#000000</strong>
